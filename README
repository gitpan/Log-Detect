0.2 Summary
===========

This package provides two modules, Log::Detect and Log::Delayed.
Log::Detect allows for GREPing a log file for error messages, and
reporting the results in a summary form.  Log::Delayed delays error
messages until all have been encountered, which is useful for parsers
and such that do not want to exit on the first error.

0.3 Log::Detect
===============

     use Log::Detect;
     my $d = new Log::Detect ();
     $d->add_regexp( warning => qr/%W/i, );
     $d->read(filename=>"test_dir/test.log");
     $d->write_stdout();
     $d->write_append();

0.4 Log::Delayed
================

     use Log::Delayed;
     my $Delayed = new Log::Delayed (filename=>"test_dir/.status");

     die_delayed ("First error into .status\n");

     if ($Delayed->errors()) {
         print "We got a error\n";
     }
     $Delayed->errors(0);  # Clear errors

     $Delayed->write_status();

     my $current_status = $Delayed->read_status();

     $Delayed->exit_if_error();

0.5 Obtaining Distribution
==========================

The latest version is available at `http://www.perl.org/CPAN/', and

0.6 Supported Systems
=====================

This version of Log::Detect has been built and tested on:

   * i386-linux

   It should run on any system with Perl5.

0.7 Installation
================

  1. `cd' to the directory containing this README notice.

  2. Type `perl Makefile.PL' to configure Log::Detect for your system.
     (Note this package will probably run slower if you are still using
     perl 5.005.)

  3. Type `make' to compile Log::Detect.  Some non-GNU makes may give
     errors about DIST_DEFAULT, if so you can simply remove that line
     from Makefile.PL, and repeat the last two steps.

  4. Type `make test' to check the compilation.

  5. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.
